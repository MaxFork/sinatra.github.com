We would like to inform you that we have released Sinatra v2.0.6. Not only that, but we also have a great news for us!

Before we begin to touch release note, I want to introduce the great news.

## Welcome to the team, Jordan!

Please join me in welcoming [Jordan Owens](https://github.com/jkowens) to the core team on Sinatra!
He has already done a lot of contributions on our projects, including sinatra, sinatra-contrib and rack-protection.
As you can see, the achievements he has made are very enormous.
I'm convinced that by welcoming him to the team, Sinatra will become more wonderful.

Sinatra has a schedule for major renovations for v3.0.0, and I expect Jordan to show strong leadership and his great technical skill in that milestone.

Once more, welcome to the team, Jordan!

## Releases

This release includes the release of the following gems:

* `sinatra`: v2.0.6
* `sinatra-contrib`: v2.0.6

In addition, want to give a special thanks to the key contributor for this release: [@304](https://github.com/304)

## Join us

We are looking for fellows like Jordan who can actively help with our development.
I would be pleased if you could actively triage bugs on github, help with issues, and cooperate for [v3.0.0](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/issues/1531).
